#Learning Journal Day 19

Today I learned more about Git-uations and how serious they can be. I ended up having to solve the same logic issues about two or three times today just because of how poorly we merged our files over the course of the day. But now I know to be more careful and thoughtful about commits and merges. I'm sure big conflicts like this will continue to exist within being a programmer, but I'm trying to learn to be more comfortable with that sort of situation.

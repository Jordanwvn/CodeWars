# Learning Journal Day 9

We're starting to really get into the style of pages, and I'm learning that I'm really not that good at it. Floats are surprisingly not as complicated as I thought they were, but everything else is still confusing to me. My CSS is incredibly messy, and I hope to clean it up when I get the chance. I learned that my skills might be pointing me more towards a path of back-end development, but I don't quite know if I want to commit to that yet. I think I still have a chance of getting up to speed on styling.

Another thing I learned was in JS. I learned from yesterday that clean code and ample comments are key to having an understandable project. I'm now trying to work in a much cleaner set of patterns, and I hope to continue to keep up with it.

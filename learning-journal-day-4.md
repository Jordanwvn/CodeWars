# Learning Journal Day 4

As we get into functions, I'm starting to be reminded of the feeling of really loving the challenges of programming. At least in JS. I'm still feeling like an amateur in the front end work of HTML and CSS. My thought is that it would be a lot easier for me to try to create an already defined layout, and I think that's quite helpful for me to know moving forward. 

After my first experience in pair programming, I think I still have a lot to learn. I learned that when I think something should be done a certain way, I try to only allow things to go that way. For example, we were using functions today and the parameters of the project were to wrap everything that already existed in a function and then call the function. That's what my teammate had me put into his code, but I continued to insist on making the code dry by instead using the functions on individual pieces to remove repetition. Overall it worked out quite well though, and I look forward to more pair programming. I'm thinking I need to be more patient and open-minded in the future. If someone is saying a solution which I think is a failing of logic, I should stop and consider / ask why they came to that conclusion.

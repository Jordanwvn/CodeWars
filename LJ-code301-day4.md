# Learning Journal Day 4

Today, I learned about AJAX, and using REST. I think the whole client -> server -> data has made sense to me since Brian first described it in the 101 that made me want to sign up for Code Fellows in the first place. I'm discovering that I know the higher level concepts, and the lower level of syntax, but I can sometimes draw blanks on how processes need to actually be handled. Through doing more and more code wars assignments, I'm really learning that logic is my favorite part of programming. But I still want to keep learning other aspects. I was surprised that I actually really enjoyed the UI Challenge today. I suppose CSS can be seen as another sort of puzzle, so maybe I'll warm up to front-end and progress towards becoming a full-stack developer.

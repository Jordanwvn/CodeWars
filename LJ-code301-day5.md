# Learning Journal Day 5

Over the past few days, I've learned a lot about SQL and server management. I really like that working with SQL is like working with spreadsheets, because that's something I really enjoy. I had hoped I would like back-end work, but now I think I've confirmed that I really enjoy the back-end. Even though I don't like dealing with the front-end, I still think I could learn to like it, I'd just like better tools for dealing with it. And it sounds like we might be getting those, so I'd still like to think I can be full-stack at this point.

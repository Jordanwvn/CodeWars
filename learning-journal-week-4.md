# learning journal week 4

this week, we learned about auth and deployment. I realized that I have never once been able to deploy a project, despite how simple the process is. I wonder if it is because I am using a different operating system, or if it's just that I always run into errors. Either way, I'm sure I'll learn about it if I need to.

# Learning Journal Day 8

today we looked at forms and events. I learned just how much of the internet is made up of forms and things like click events, which really helped me understand the scope of usefulness these types of skill had. When Brian mentioned some of the topics covered in 301 and 401 throughout the lecture, I really felt like I had an eye opening experience of understanding how much we'll be able to do once we finish this course. I think this class has already taught me a lot about the immense usefulness of software development in addition to teaching me how to actually do it.

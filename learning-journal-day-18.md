#Learning Journal Day 18

Today I learned that not having anything to do is a lot more of a problem for me than having a lot to do. I was struggling today to really put together some tasks to work on, and when I did they tended to be little things I just told others how to directly add to their code. I suppose I'm also learning that I don't know how to delegate work to four people when in my mind we only need one person's work. I'm a bit disappointed in what I got done today, and I'd really like to show a lot more improvement tomorrow.

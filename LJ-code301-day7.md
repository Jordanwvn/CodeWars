# Learning Journal Day 7

Over the past few days, I've learned quite a bit on server-side work. Today was the first day I was actually able to work in SQL on my computer. I really enjoy it, even if it is a bit finicky and unforgiving. I could really see myself working more with databases in the future. I'm still a bit confused on Heroku, but I'm sure that understanding will come in time just like it did for GitHub.

Because of some issues with uploading to Heroku on my computer, I was navigating for most of the lab today. It concerns me a bit that we couldn't get it to work, because I really felt like I didn't learn as much when the keyboard wasn't in my hands. So ideally, I'd like to get that figured out tomorrow.

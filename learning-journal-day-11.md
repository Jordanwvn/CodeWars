# Learning Journal Day 11

Today we worked on the Sky Bus project, and I remembered what it was like to get stuck on a logic problem for hours on end. I learned a pretty valuable lesson though. I started out the project by writing this cool set of validation functions I built in my head. So once I was ready to test, I already had a lot of code in the file. This led to hours and hours of complicated testing and not knowing how to diagnose what was going on. I got so caught up in making those functions that I didn't get my code to a state where I knew the core elements were working before moving on. And after all of those lost hours, I ended up finding a much better solution which did the same work in about a quarter of the code.

So what I took away was that I should look for ways to start building my code from a point where I can get to testing right away. If I just keep pushing onwards without the ability to have any output to test, once I get to the debugging stage I'll potentially have a nightmare on my hands. I'll look for ways to start my code building by getting an output that I can debug, and then once that's working move on to more complicated features.

# Learning Journal Day 12

today was a fairly simple day as far as learning goes. I essentially got the lab done before lab even started. All we did was plus charts.js into our data, so I had no problem finishing up after I worked so hard on yesterday's assignment. I suppose I could say that I observed how putting in a lot of hard work when it's called upon can allow you to have times of relaxation if you do a good job. I'm actually really proud of how my Sky Bus site looks, and I'm really enjoying the capabilities I have with JS, HTML, and CSS. I think I'm going to start a personal project soon once I understand more about the capabilities of local storage.

# Week 1 Learning Journal

This week, it seems like we've already covered a lot, even though it still seems like there's a lot of room for the difficulty to ramp up. After our 3 week break, I really understand the importance of looking at code every day like Brian told us in 201. Coming back to coding took some time for me, and I felt very rusty for the first few days since the prework, even though I programmed a few times a week.

I've noticed that one of the harder things for me to do in code is to comfortably use something without fully understanding it. I recognize that this is not the mindset I should be in, and I want to get better at it. But one thing that really stood out to me was how much more sense things like "require" made when I had to use it myself as opposed to it being a part of starter code in 301.

I'm thinking that the bitmap project is really going to rock me, but I look forward to taking it on. In the same vein as the last point, whenever something challenges me and I solve it by using starter code I don't feel like I learned anything. But now that we're doing similar things from scratch, I really feel a sense of accomplishment by completing the assignments on my own.

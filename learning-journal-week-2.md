# Learning Journal Week 2

This week has definitely held a lot of new information for me. While it has held a lot of personal struggle, it has really showed me the things I'm good at. Which isn't the majority of what we've been working on in labs, but it still helps with my personal 'sell'. I'd say my pitch right now is that I'm a dedicated problem solver who's skilled with logic and abstract data structures. I know that will help me interview well as far as whiteboarding goes, but I'm somewhat concerned about how tough it is for me to work with things like RESTful programming. I'm really hoping that something just makes it click for me, because I really like everything else about the back end. Another lesson I've learned, relating to our labs, is to know when to go to sleep. This is the first time I've really been sleep-deprived in this program, and I'm learning that a lot of the time getting even a little more sleep can be a monumental difference in how much I can pay attention in lecture and then work on the next lab. It's also shown me that I need to be smart about what I choose to finish and what I choose to ignore. This whole course so far has been a good lesson on how to work with 0 personal time.

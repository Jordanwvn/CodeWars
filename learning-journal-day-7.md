# Learning Journal Day 7

We're finally starting to compact our code with constructors and I'm really loving it. I've learned just how much constructors can do to shorten code, and I feel like a whole new world was unlocked. It seems like everything in the syntax makes sense now that we have the tools to explain it. Like, I can logically parse out why a piece of code is acting the way it is. I really like the pace we've been taking things at, especially with having us do the long way before the shortcut. I feel like that has been an essential part of this education.

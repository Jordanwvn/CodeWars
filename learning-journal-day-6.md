#Learning Journal Day 6

Today we started our work with objects and I really had a good time. Knowing about objects really provides a mind-blow moment where everything we've been using becomes contextualized, and logic is just that much easier to understand. I look forward to utilizing objects even more as we move to constructors.

I'm also learning a lot about HTML. As I've had some experience in the past with JS, I didn't really see the benefits of module based learning quite yet. But now that it's been a week, I'm really starting to see those benefits in CSS / HTML. I'm much more comfortable with those languages, and I'm finding more confidence to experiment and learn new ways to do things. In the past I thought I would likely be leaning towards back-end, but I think full-stack might actually end up fitting me, which I would really enjoy.

As for interacting with others, I'm still trying to learn how much of my time to dedicate to helping those who ask for it. As someone with some experience in JS, I've gotten plenty of people coming up to me during lab time asking me to solve their problems. I try to do my best, but I'm not a TA and I have my own project to work on. I've tried headphones, but I don't think our class is really at the level to respect that yet. I'll keep trying to find a balance, but in the mean time helping others is at least still rewarding.

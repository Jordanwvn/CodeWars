# Learning Journal Day 15

Today, we began working on final projects by getting set up and delegating work. I learned through that process that I really like to do a lot of things on my own. Or, at least it's very satisfying for me to know I'm taking care of every element of something. That being said, I do somewhat like how little it feels like I have to do when it comes to delegation of work. I feel very comfortable with how much time I have to complete my tasks, and that makes me feel guaranteed that I will get the work done. Going forward, I suppose I'll have to focus on my own contributions, and just go along with what I'm given. It's more helpful to both myself and others to not step over that amount, assuming what I'd want to do has already been given to someone else.

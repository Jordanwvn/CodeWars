# learning journal week 8

This last week, we worked on binary search trees, which I think are one of my favorite data structures. I'm not quite sure what it is about data structures, but I've always been so drawn to them and fully understand them. Maybe it's my past minor in CS and familiarity with them. Or maybe it's my experience in 3D visualization that helps me understand how to imagine them. Either way, I really hope I have the chance to work with such structures in the work place, even though I know that's probably not too likely.

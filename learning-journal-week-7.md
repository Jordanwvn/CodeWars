# learning journal week 7

This week, we learned about Redux, and I learned how behind getting sick can make you in Code Fellows. I was sick when we were learning about redux, and it really negatively affected my comprehension of the topic, leading to me not following the lectures all week. Now that I have a better understanding of Redux, I hope I can catch up to my peers.

# Learning Journal Day 13

today, I learned to never assume a task will be as simple as you think it will be. I blew through one element of local storage in a few minutes, then put off the rest of it because I figured it would be just as easy. Getting my chart to update without creating a duplicate chart ended up taking me a lot longer than I thought. I did get it done, however, and was somewhat satisfied with the result. However, for the future, I now know to be more careful about assumptions for time.

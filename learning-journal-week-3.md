# learning journal week 3: CRUDdy servers

This week, we focused mostly on creating and testing servers with full CRUD operations. I kind of realized that making servers from scratch really didn't make sense to me. At least with the methods we were using. I thought that having two seperate functions on different parts of the program to enact one function seemed a bit confusing. Because of that, I had a hard time wrapping my head around what we were working with. However, now that we're working with MongoDB and all of the CRUD operations are in one file, it makes a lot more sense and I didn't struggle at all.

I think gaining that perspective has really helped me shape how I want to start my personal pitch. It has kind of shown me that I work really well with logical problems to come to logical and efficient solutions. But I can flounder if I think the problem being handed to me is illogical. That certainly gives me something to work on.

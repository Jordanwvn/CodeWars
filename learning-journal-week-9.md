# learning journal week 9

This week we covered sorting algorithms, and I had a lot of fun with it. I tried out the radix sort, and I thought the implementation of it was really creative and intuitive. I was kind of let down to hear that it's not too common of a sort, and now I want to learn about bucket sort, which has apparently surpassed it. Regardless, I hope to eventually have a strong understanding of what sorting algorithms are most efficient to any situation.
